        <h3>How does Davenport Wardrobe work?</h3>
        <p>
          Davenport Wardrobe gives you access to a rotating wardrobe of
          high-quality clothing. Select pieces, receive them at your doorstep,
          wear them on your terms, then return them or purchase them at a
          reduced price as they age.

        <h3>Is this a rental service?</h3>
        <p>
          Not in the traditional sense. Davenport Wardrobe focuses on access,
          flexibility, and longevity. You are not locked into ownership, and
          pricing adjusts as garments are worn over time.
